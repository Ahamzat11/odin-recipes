# odin-recipes
My Odin Recipes website, my first project.

Adding alt text to the food photos

Screen reader will not read the images to those in need without this

Changed to a relative link for the photo

Able to load faster when opening the web page

Created links back to the Index pages

Easier to navigate between pages
